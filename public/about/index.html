    <h1>About Queue N' A</h1>
    <p>
      Queue N' A is an app made by developers for developers. Over years sites with message boards have become a staple in how developers learn and communicate. Users usually log on and post a question and other devs answer it and offer advice. The only issue is with these types of sites is that developers have to post on a message board and wait around for someone to respond. This is why Queue N' A came to be. Instead of waiting around for someone to answer a message board, users can enter chatrooms specifically made for thier language and get help from fellow devs in real time. Developers who want to fine tune their skills can also enter chatrooms and challenge themselves to help other devs with their code.
